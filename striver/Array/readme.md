# Array Problems â€“ Essential Operations in C++

This folder contains C++ implementations of fundamental array operations and classic interview problems. Each file demonstrates a key concept or technique for working with arrays efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- [Check if Array is Sorted](./check%20the%20array%20is%20sorted.cpp)  
  Checks whether the array is sorted in ascending order.

- [Find Missing Number](./Find_Missing_number.cpp)  
  Finds the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers from 0 to n.

- [Maximum Consecutive Ones](./Maximum_Consecutive_Ones.cpp)  
  Finds the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.

- [Move Zeros](./Move_the_zero.cpp)  
  Moves all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

- [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](./remove_dupliactes_fromSortedArray.cpp)  
  Removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place and returns the new length.

- [Rotate Array](./RotateArray.cpp)  
  Rotates the array to the right by k steps using an efficient approach.

- [Union of Two Sorted Arrays](./Union_two_sorted_array.cpp)  
  Finds the union of two sorted arrays, maintaining sorted order and removing duplicates.
