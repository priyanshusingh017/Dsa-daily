# Array Problems â€“ Essential Operations in C++

This folder contains C++ implementations of fundamental array operations and classic interview problems. Each file demonstrates a key concept or technique for working with arrays efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- [Check if Array is Sorted](./check%20the%20array%20is%20sorted.cpp)  
  Checks whether the array is sorted in ascending order.

- [Find the Largest Element](./Find_the_largest_element.cpp)  
  Finds the largest element in the array.

- [Second Largest Element](./Second_largest_element.cpp)  
  Finds the second largest element in the array.

- [Find Missing Number](./Find_Missing_number.cpp)  
  Finds the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers from 0 to n.

- [Maximum Consecutive Ones](./Maximum_Consecutive_Ones.cpp)  
  Finds the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.

- [Move Zeros](./Move_the_zero.cpp)  
  Moves all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

- [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](./remove_dupliactes_fromSortedArray.cpp)  
  Removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place and returns the new length.

- [Rotate Array](./RotateArray.cpp)  
  Rotates the array to the right by k steps using an efficient approach.

- [Union of Two Sorted Arrays](./Union_two_sorted_array.cpp)  
  Finds the union of two sorted arrays, maintaining sorted order and removing duplicates.

- [Sort an Array of 0s, 1s and 2s](./Sort%20an%20array%20of%200s,%201s%20and%202s.cpp)  
  Sorts an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag problem).

- [Kadane's Algorithm â€“ Maximum Subarray Sum](./Kadane's%20Algorithm_Maximum%20Subarray%20Sum%20in%20an%20Array.cpp)  
  Finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's Algorithm.

- [Extended Version of Kadane's Algorithm](./Extend_versionOf_kadane's_Algorithm.cpp)  
  Solves advanced variations of the maximum subarray sum problem.

- [Longest Subarray with Given Sum K (Positives)](./Longest%20Subarray%20with%20given%20Sum%20K(Positives).cpp)  
  Finds the longest subarray with a given sum K (for positive numbers).

- [Longest Subarray with Sum K (Positives and Negatives)](./Longest%20Subarray%20with%20sum%20K_Postives%20and%20Negatives.cpp)  
  Finds the longest subarray with a given sum K (for both positive and negative numbers).

- [Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](./Rearrange%20Array%20Elements%20by%20Sign.cpp)  
  Rearranges the array so that positive and negative numbers alternate.

- [Single Number](./Single%20number.cpp)  
  Finds the element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice.
