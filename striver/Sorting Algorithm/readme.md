# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains C++ implementations of classic sorting algorithms for DSA practice:

- **Bubble Sort**: [View Code](./bubblesort.cpp)  
  Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Simple but inefficient for large datasets.

- **Selection Sort**: [View Code](./selection%20sort.cpp)  
  Repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part. Simple but not very efficient for large datasets.

- **Insertion Sort**: [View Code](./insertionsort.cpp)  
  Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position. Efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.

- **Merge Sort**: [View Code](./mergesort.cpp)  
  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them. Guarantees O(n log n) time complexity.

- **Quick Sort**: [View Code](./quicksort.cpp)  
  Picks a pivot, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions. Very fast on average, but worst-case is O(n^2).

Each algorithm is implemented with clear code and comments for easy understanding.
