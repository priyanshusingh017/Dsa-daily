# Learn the Basics

This folder contains fundamental C++ programs and explanations to help you build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each topic is covered with clear code and comments for easy understanding.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Number Theory
- [Armstrong Number](./Armstrongnumber.cpp): Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
- [Check Prime](./check%20the%20prime.cpp): Determine if a number is prime.
- [Count Digits](./count_digit.cpp): Count the number of digits in a number.
- [Factorial](./factorial.cpp): Calculate the factorial of a number.
- [Fibonacci Number](./Fibonacci%20Number.cpp): Generate Fibonacci numbers.
- [GCD of Two Numbers](./gcd_two_number.cpp): Find the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- [Print All Divisors](./Print%20all%20Divisors%20of%20a%20given%20Number.cpp): List all divisors of a given number.

### Arrays & Hashing
- [Count Frequency of Each Element](./Count%20frequency%20of%20each%20element%20in%20the%20array.cpp): Count occurrences of each element in an array.
- [Hashing](./hashing.cpp): Basic hashing techniques for arrays.
- [Reverse Array](./reverse%20array.cpp): Reverse the elements of an array.

### Strings & Palindromes
- [Palindrome](./palindrome.cpp): Check if a string or number is a palindrome.
- [Valid Palindrome](./Valid%20Palindrome.cpp): Validate if a string is a palindrome, possibly with constraints.
- [Reverse String](./reverse.cpp): Reverse a string.

### Patterns
The `pattern/` subfolder contains C++ programs for various pattern printing problems, such as:
- [p1.cpp](./pattern/p1.cpp), [p2.cpp](./pattern/p2.cpp), ..., [p22.cpp](./pattern/p22.cpp):  
  Classic pattern problems to build logic and strengthen your understanding of loops and nested structures.
