# Recursion â€“ Classic Algorithms and Problems in C++

This folder demonstrates how recursion can be used to solve classic problems and implement fundamental algorithms, as part of the Striver DSA series. Each example is designed to build your understanding of recursive thinking and its application in algorithm design.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- [Bubble Sort Using Recursion](./bubblesort_using_recursion.cpp)  
  Recursively sorts the array by repeatedly moving the largest unsorted element to the end.

- [Insertion Sort Using Recursion](./insertionsort_using_recursion.cpp)  
  Recursively sorts the array by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted part.

- [Selection Sort Using Recursion](./selectionsort_using_recursion.cpp)  
  Recursively finds the minimum element in the unsorted part and moves it to the correct position.

- [Fibonacci Series Using Recursion](./Fibonnaci_series.cpp)  
  Generates Fibonacci numbers using a simple recursive approach.

- [Power Function Using Recursion](./powerfunction_using_recursion.cpp)  
  Efficiently computes $x^n$ (x raised to the power n) using recursive exponentiation by squaring, handling all edge cases.

- [Count Good Numbers](./count%20good%20number.cpp)  
  Solves the "Count Good Numbers" problem using recursion and modular exponentiation, demonstrating how to handle large exponents and modulo operations.
