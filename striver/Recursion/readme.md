# Recursion

This folder contains C++ implementations of sorting algorithms using recursion, as part of the Striver DSA series.

## ðŸ“š Included Programs

- [Bubble Sort Using Recursion](./bubblesort_using_recursion.cpp):  
  Implements the bubble sort algorithm recursively, demonstrating how sorting logic can be applied without explicit loops.

- [Insertion Sort Using Recursion](./insertionsort_using_recursion.cpp):  
  Implements the insertion sort algorithm recursively, showing how elements can be inserted in order using recursive calls.

---

Each program is written with clear code and comments to help you understand the recursive approach to classic sorting algorithms. Explore these files to deepen your understanding of recursion in DSA!
