     ** THIS KEYWORD - 
     The this keyword in C++ is a pointer that refers to the current object instance of a class. 
     It is commonly used inside class methods and constructors to distinguish between member variables and parameters with the same name.
     this->health = health; inside the constructor assigns the value of the parameter health to the member variable health of the current object. 
     Without this->, the assignment would be ambiguous because both the parameter and the member variable are named health.
     
     Example analogy:
     Think of this as saying "my own"â€”so this->health means "my own health variable," not the one passed in as a parameter.
